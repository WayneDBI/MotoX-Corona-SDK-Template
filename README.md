Ever wanted to create a Bike Simulator or a Motor Bike stunts game? Here is a complete project file to get you started! This template features many cool tricks; including multiple animation states depending on the bikers actions. Perform tricks, 360s, wheelies, front ends and much, much more… Control the bike as you perform cool tricks and pull off some in-air stunts. The mechanics include crash detection, with animations and various physics detection routines.

We have built this template so that the user must simply get to the finish line, but with a few more tweaks you could easily convert this into a skiing game, bob sleigh, bikes, boats, tanks, buggies, babies in prams! … Or maybe even a uni-cycling clown???
